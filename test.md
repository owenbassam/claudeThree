Anthropic's Sonnet 4.5 Challenge: UMD Submissions
Claude Sonnet 4.5 is out now!

Anthropic just released Claude Sonnet 4.5, the best model in the world for complex agents, coding, and computer use. Sonnet 4.5 takes the lead on SWE-bench Verified with industry-leading performance. With extended thinking capabilities, Sonnet 4.5 spends more time reasoning through responses for better performance on demanding tasks ranging from planning to research to coding. It also follows instructions more reliably, identifies code improvements better, shows stronger refactoring judgment, and generates more production-ready code.

As a student member of the Claude Builder Club, you get access to Claude Pro. While using Pro, you can also now use Claude to create and edit Excel spreadsheets, documents, PowerPoint slide decks, and PDFs — this will be a game changer for school projects.

48 Hour App Challenge: Description + Rules

To celebrate the launch of Sonnet 4.5, we’re hosting an app building challenge. Starting RIGHT NOW, you have 2 days to build an app with Sonnet 4.5. 

You can build your app with any platform (Claude Code, claude.com, VSCode, XCode, Cursor, Windsurf, etc) and it can be any type of app. The only requirement is that all of the code is generated within the 48 hour period with Sonnet 4.5, and your app pushes the limits of what’s possible to create with AI-assisted coding.

We’ll be selecting the best app created at the University of Maryland to win a mystery prize and a gigantic goose plushie ($100+ in value). Every participant also gets Claude merch.

Once you’re ready, submit your app by filling out this form (forms.gle/AAdsa1Hz1XtrUTMV9). The deadline is Friday, October 3 @ 11:59 PM ET.
