## Overview

An intelligent learning platform that transforms passive content consumption into active, Socratic dialogue. Whether it's a YouTube video or a PDF document, Claude AI guides you through questionsâ€”not lecturesâ€”ensuring understanding is proven, not assumed.

### Core Philosophy

**"The AI questions you. You'll never reach the top. But every correct answer pushes you higher."**

Like Sisyphus eternally pushing his boulder, learning is an endless climb. Answer correctly and roll higher up the hill. Fail, and watch the boulder tumble back down. There's no summitâ€”just the eternal pursuit of deeper understanding through Socratic questioning.

### What Makes This Unique

- **Socratic Method**: AI asks questions, you answerâ€”discover understanding through dialogue
- **Sisyphean Progress**: Never reach the top, but roll higher with each correct answer
- **Boulder Mechanics**: Fail, and your progress rolls back downâ€”success must be re-earned
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: The hill grows steeper as you climbâ€”challenge scales with skill
- **Multiple Content**: Works with YouTube videos AND PDF documents
- **No Shortcuts**: Understanding can't be skippedâ€”it must be proven

## How It Works

### User Workflow

```
1. Choose input: YouTube URL OR PDF upload
   â†“
2. AI analyzes content (chapters, concepts, key points)
   â†“
3. Start conversation with AI tutor
   â†“
4. Review assigned content section
   â†“
5. Answer comprehension questions
   â†“
6. Pass (â‰¥70) â†’ Unlock next chapter
   Fail â†’ Review and try again
   â†“
7. Repeat until complete
```

### State Machine

```
WATCHING
  â†“ (User watches section)
POST_WATCH
  â†“ (AI asks question)
EVALUATING
  â†“ (AI scores 0-100)
  â”œâ”€ â‰¥70 â†’ CHECKPOINT (unlock next)
  â”œâ”€ 50-69 â†’ FOLLOW_UP (probe deeper)
  â””â”€ <50 â†’ REVIEW (rewatch section)
```

### Frustration Detection

After 2 consecutive failures, the AI offers help:
- **Hint**: Guidance about the key concept
- **Simpler Question**: Easier version to build confidence
- **Rewatch**: Specific guidance on what to focus on

### Data Persistence

**Client-Side Storage**
- Conversation state saved to localStorage
- Persists across page refreshes
- Unique per video ID
- Resume learning anytime

**State Tracked:**
```typescript
{
  unlockedChapters: [0, 1],
  chapterScores: { "0": 85, "1": 72 },
  currentChapterIndex: 1,
  consecutiveFailures: 0,
  totalFailures: 2,
  checkpoints: [...],
  messages: [...]
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Video won't load?**
- Check YouTube URL format
- Ensure video has public transcript
- Try a different educational video

**Q: AI responses slow?**
- First response initializes conversation (slower)
- Subsequent responses are faster
- Check AWS Bedrock region latency

**Q: Can't unlock next chapter?**
- Must score â‰¥70 on current chapter
- Try rewatching and answering again
- Use "hint" or "simpler" commands if stuck

**Q: Progress lost on refresh?**
- Check browser localStorage is enabled
- Each video has unique saved state
- State persists across sessions
