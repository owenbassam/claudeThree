## 🎤 Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions:

**Q: "What if there's no transcript?"**
A: "Great question! We detect that and inform the user. Most educational channels enable transcripts. We're also exploring automatic speech-to-text for videos without them."

**Q: "How accurate is the AI analysis?"**
A: "Claude 4.5 Sonnet is highly accurate for educational content. We've tested it across various subjects and it consistently identifies key concepts and generates relevant questions."

**Q: "Can this scale?"**
A: "Absolutely! We're using AWS Bedrock which scales automatically. The bottleneck is YouTube's rate limits, not our architecture."

**Q: "What's the cost per video?"**
A: "With Bedrock pricing, approximately $0.10-0.30 per video depending on length. Far cheaper than manual content creation."

**Q: "What languages does it support?"**
A: "Currently English, but Claude supports 100+ languages. We can easily extend this."

**Q: "Can I use this for corporate training?"**
A: "Yes! Any video platform with transcripts would work. We focused on YouTube for the demo, but the architecture is flexible."

## 🎯 Success Metrics to Mention

- ⚡ "Processes a 10-minute video in ~20 seconds"
- 🎓 "Generates 5-8 chapter breakdowns on average"
- 💡 "Identifies 10-15 key concepts per video"
- ❓ "Creates 5-10 quiz questions automatically"
