6. Learning progress tracked visually
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Key Technical Decisions:

#### 1. React Player Integration
- **Library**: react-player (v3.3.3)
- **Approach**: Used forwardRef pattern for external control
- **Why**: Reliable YouTube embedding with programmatic control

#### 2. Component Communication
```typescript
// Parent holds video ref
const videoPlayerRef = useRef<VideoPlayerRef>(null);

// Children trigger video jumps
const handleJumpToTime = (timestamp: number) => {
  if (videoPlayerRef.current) {
    videoPlayerRef.current.seekTo(timestamp);
  }
};

// Video updates shared state
const handleTimeUpdate = (time: number) => {
  setCurrentTime(time);
};
```

#### 3. State Management
- **Current Time**: Shared state updated by video player
- **Chapter Detection**: Calculated based on timestamp comparison
- **Progress Calculation**: Dynamic based on chapter boundaries
